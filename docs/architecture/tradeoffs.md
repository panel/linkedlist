# LinkedList Architectural Trade-offs

This document outlines the key architectural trade-offs and decision points for the LinkedList application, explaining the reasoning behind each choice.

## 1. Data Storage

### Decision: Use Supabase Postgres for all data
- **Pros**: 
  - Unified storage solution simplifies architecture
  - Built-in row-level security
  - Relational model fits the interconnected nature of links, notes, and labels
  - Native JSON support for potential schema flexibility
  
- **Cons**:
  - May require optimization for text search at scale
  - Could be overkill for simple document storage needs
  
- **Rationale**: The unified approach significantly simplifies our stack while still providing all the capabilities we need. Supabase offers an excellent developer experience and built-in security features that align with our multi-tenancy requirements.

## 2. Authentication

### Decision: Lucia with multiple providers (Bluesky, GitHub, Google)
- **Pros**:
  - Maximum flexibility for users
  - Support for modern identity providers
  - Clear separation of auth logic
  
- **Cons**:
  - More complex setup compared to single auth provider
  - Need to maintain provider-specific code paths
  
- **Rationale**: Supporting multiple auth providers improves the user experience by allowing them to authenticate with existing accounts. Lucia provides a unified API for managing these different providers while maintaining security.

## 3. Rendering Strategy

### Decision: Server-side rendering with hydration for most pages
- **Pros**:
  - Better SEO for public content
  - Faster initial page loads
  - Progressive enhancement
  
- **Cons**:
  - More complex rendering logic
  - Potential for slower subsequent navigation
  
- **Rationale**: With the possibility of public-facing content, SSR provides SEO benefits while maintaining the responsiveness of a SPA after hydration. SvelteKit makes this approach straightforward to implement.

## 4. Link vs. Note Structure

### Decision: Links as primary objects with notes as child elements
- **Pros**:
  - Clear ownership hierarchy
  - Simple organization model
  - Intuitive for users
  
- **Cons**:
  - May complicate certain cross-cutting queries
  - Requires careful index design
  
- **Rationale**: This structure mirrors the conceptual model of the application, where links are the primary entities being saved and organized, with notes providing additional context over time.

## 5. Public/Private Content

### Decision: Database-level visibility controls with row-level security
- **Pros**:
  - Security enforced at data tier
  - Impossible to accidentally expose private data
  - Clean separation of concerns
  
- **Cons**:
  - More complex RLS policies
  - Potential performance impact from RLS
  
- **Rationale**: Implementing visibility at the database level provides the strongest security guarantees and simplifies application logic, as the database will only return data the user is authorized to see.

## 6. API Strategy

### Decision: Initial RESTful design with room for GraphQL evolution
- **Pros**:
  - Straightforward implementation with SvelteKit
  - Well-understood patterns
  - Easily cacheable
  
- **Cons**:
  - Less flexible for complex querying needs
  - More endpoints to maintain over time
  
- **Rationale**: Starting with REST provides a simple, proven approach that aligns well with SvelteKit's routing. We can evolve to GraphQL later if complex querying needs emerge.

## 7. State Management

### Decision: Svelte 5 built-in reactivity with stores
- **Pros**:
  - Native to the framework
  - Simple mental model
  - Reduced dependencies
  
- **Cons**:
  - May become unwieldy for very complex state
  - Less structured than dedicated solutions
  
- **Rationale**: Svelte 5's built-in reactivity features are powerful enough for our needs without adding the complexity of external state management libraries.

## 8. Search Implementation

### Decision: Postgres full-text search
- **Pros**:
  - No additional infrastructure
  - Integrated with existing data
  - Good performance for moderate scale
  
- **Cons**:
  - Less advanced features than dedicated search solutions
  - May have scaling limitations
  
- **Rationale**: Postgres full-text search provides good capabilities without the operational complexity of a separate search service. We can evaluate moving to a dedicated solution if search requirements become more advanced.

## 9. Deployment Platform

### Decision: Vercel
- **Pros**:
  - Native SvelteKit support
  - Global CDN
  - Simple CI/CD integration
  - Free tier for development
  
- **Cons**:
  - Vendor lock-in concerns
  - Limited customization compared to raw infrastructure
  
- **Rationale**: Vercel's specialized support for SvelteKit makes deployment simple and reliable, with excellent performance characteristics out of the box.

## 10. Security Model 

### Decision: Multi-layered security approach
- **Pros**:
  - Defense in depth
  - Clear security boundaries
  - Auth handled at multiple levels
  
- **Cons**:
  - More complex implementation
  - Potential performance impacts
  
- **Rationale**: Given the personal nature of saved links and notes, a robust security approach is warranted even if it introduces some additional complexity.

## Summary

These trade-offs represent our current thinking based on the requirements and constraints understood at this time. As the project evolves, we should revisit these decisions regularly to ensure they still align with project goals and requirements.
