## Decision Points & Milestones

Each phase includes specific decision points that may impact subsequent work:

1. **Authentication Provider Selection** (Foundation Phase)
   - Validate all three auth providers work as expected
   - May require adjustments based on provider constraints

2. **Data Model Validation** (Core Features Phase)
   - Review query performance with real data
   - Potential schema adjustments based on usage patterns

3. **Search Implementation Approach** (Enhanced Features Phase)
   - Evaluate Postgres search performance
   - Decide if additional search infrastructure is needed

4. **Performance Assessment** (Refinement Phase)
   - Identify performance targets and measure against them
   - Make architectural adjustments if needed
