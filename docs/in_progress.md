# LinkedList Project Bootstrap

## Target Goal
Get a basic version of LinkedList running locally with minimal functionality, focusing on the project structure and core UI components. This initial version will serve as a foundation for future development without requiring integration with external services yet.

## Current Status - Foundation Phase Complete ✅

We have successfully built the foundation of the LinkedList application. The application is now running locally with mock data and basic functionality.

### Completed Tasks:

#### 1. Project Setup ✅
- Created a new SvelteKit project with TypeScript
- Set up TailwindCSS for styling
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Created the basic project structure

#### 2. Basic UI Components ✅
- Implemented AppLayout with header and navigation
- Created LinkCard component for displaying links
- Implemented LinkForm for adding and editing links
- Set up responsive design with TailwindCSS

#### 3. Data Model Implementation ✅
- Created TypeScript interfaces for core entities (User, Link, Note, Label)
- Implemented mock data services for development
- Set up reactive stores with Svelte
- Created a mock database implementation for local development

#### 4. Core Pages Implementation ✅
- Created home/dashboard page
- Implemented link listing view with filtering
- Created link detail view with notes
- Added link creation and editing interfaces
- Implemented labels management page

#### 5. Mock Authentication ✅
- Created login page with mock authentication
- Implemented simple client-side auth store
- Set up for future integration with Lucia

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Testing** - Add test cases for core functionality
2. **Enhancements** - Improve error handling and loading states
3. **Documentation** - Add comprehensive inline documentation

## Future Integration Plans

Once the foundation is solid, we'll:

1. Replace mock data with actual Supabase integration
2. Implement Lucia auth with providers (Bluesky, GitHub, Google)
3. Add row-level security in Supabase
4. Implement the remaining core features:
   - Enhanced search and discovery
   - Public/private controls with sharing
   - Publishing workflow for notes

## Technical Achievements

- **Clean Architecture** - Clear separation between UI, data, and logic
- **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- **Reactive UI** - Leveraging Svelte 5's reactivity model
- **Mock First Approach** - Development without external dependencies
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Structure that allows phased implementation

## Lessons Learned

- Handle environment variables carefully to avoid runtime errors
- Design for both authenticated and unauthenticated states from the beginning
- Implement mock services that closely match planned API structures
